Chapter 1 - Cells and Genomes
  * The Universal Features of Cells on Earth
    - All Cells Store Their Hereditary Information in the Same Linear Chemical Code: DNA
    - All Cells Replicate Their Hereditary Information by Templated Polymerization
    - All Cells Transcribe Portions of Their Hereditary Information into the Same Intermediary Form: RNA
    - All Cells Use Proteins as Catalysts
    - All Cells Translate RNA into Protein in the Same Way
    - Each Protein Is Encoded by a Specific Gene
    - Life Requires Free Energy
    - All Cells Function as Biochemical Factories Dealing with the Same Basic Molecular Building Blocks
    - All Cells Are Enclosed in a Plasma Membrane Across Which Nutrients and Waste Materials Must Pass
    - A Living Cell Can Exist with Fewer Than 500 Genes
    - Summary
  * The Diversity of Genomes and the Tree of Life
    - Cells Can Be Powered by a Variety of Free-Energy Sources
    - Some Cells Fix Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide for Others
    - The Greatest Biochemical Diversity Exists Among Prokaryotic Cells
    - The Tree of Life Has Three Primary Branches: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes
    - Some Genes Evolve Rapidly; Others Are Highly Conserved
    - Most Bacteria and Archaea Have 1000-6000 Genes
    - New Genes Are Generated from Preexisting Genes
    - Gene Duplications Give Rise to Families of Related Genes Within a Single Cell
    - Genes Can Be Transferred Between Organisms, Both in the Laboratory and in Nature
    - Sex Results in Horizontal Exchange of Genetic Information Within a Species
    - The Function of a Gene Can Often Be Deduced from Its Sequence
    - More Than 200 Gene Families Are Common to All Three Primary Branches of the Tree of Life
    - Mutations Reveal the Functions of Genes
    - Molecular Biology Began with a Spotlight on E. coli
    - Summary
  * Genetic Information in Eukaryotes
    - Eukaryotic Cells May Have Originated as Predators
    - Modern Eukaryotic Cells Evolved from a Symbiosis+
    - Eukaryotes Have Hybrid Genomes
    - Eukaryotic Genomes Are Big
    - Eukaryotic Genomes Are Rich in Regulatory DNA
    - The Genome Defines the Program of Multicellular Development
    - Many Eukaryotes Live as Solitary Cells
    - A Yeast Serves as a Minimal Model Eukaryote
    - The Expression Levels of All the Genes of An Organism Can Be Monitored Simultaneously
    - Arabidopsis Has Been Chosen Out of 300,000 Species As a Model Plant
    - The World of Animal Cells Is Represented By a Worm, a Fly, a Fish, a Mouse, and a Human
    - Studies in Drosophila Provide a Key to Vertebrate Development
    - The Vertebrate Genome Is a Product of Repeated Duplications
    - The Frog and the Zebrafish Provide Accessible Models for Vertebrate Development
    - The Mouse Is the Predominant Mammalian Model Organism
    - Humans Report on Their Own Peculiarities
    - We Are All Different in Detail
    - To Understand Cells and Organisms Will Require Mathematics, Computers, and Quantitative Information

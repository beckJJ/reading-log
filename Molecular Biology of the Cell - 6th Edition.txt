Chapter 1 - Cells and Genomes
  * The Universal Features of Cells on Earth
    - All Cells Store Their Hereditary Information in the Same Linear Chemical Code: DNA
    - All Cells Replicate Their Hereditary Information by Templated Polymerization
    - All Cells Transcribe Portions of Their Hereditary Information into the Same Intermediary Form: RNA
    - All Cells Use Proteins as Catalysts
    - All Cells Translate RNA into Protein in the Same Way
    - Each Protein Is Encoded by a Specific Gene
    - Life Requires Free Energy
    - All Cells Function as Biochemical Factories Dealing with the Same Basic Molecular Building Blocks
    - All Cells Are Enclosed in a Plasma Membrane Across Which Nutrients and Waste Materials Must Pass
    - A Living Cell Can Exist with Fewer Than 500 Genes
    - Summary
  * The Diversity of Genomes and the Tree of Life
    - Cells Can Be Powered by a Variety of Free-Energy Sources
    - Some Cells Fix Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide for Others
    - The Greatest Biochemical Diversity Exists Among Prokaryotic Cells
    - The Tree of Life Has Three Primary Branches: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes
    - Some Genes Evolve Rapidly; Others Are Highly Conserved
    - Most Bacteria and Archaea Have 1000-6000 Genes
